## contest
Contest is minimalistic testing framework bundled with a freaking fast console test runner. In contrast with most popular testing frameworks, it's based on conventions, so it doesn't require a whole lotta of attributes to identify tests artifacts such as test methods, test fixtures, test setups and so on and so forth. So in the end the code reads almost like plain english.

Down below youâ€™ll find a couple of examples on how to write tests using Contest.

_Please keep in mind this is a protoype and is not production ready (yet). It'll be relased in the near future tough. Stay tuned!_
```cs
	using _  = System.Action<Contest.Core.Runner>;

    /// Basic features.
    class Contest_101 {

		_ passing_test = assert => 
			assert.Equal(4, 2 + 2);

		_ failing_test = assert =>
			assert.Equal(5, 2 + 2);
	
		_ expected_exception_passing_test = test =>
			test.ShouldThrow<NullReferenceException>(() => {
				object target = null;
				var dummy = target.ToString();
				//================^ null reference ex.
			});
	
		_ expected_exception_failing_test = test =>
			test.ShouldThrow<NullReferenceException>(() => {
				//It doesn't throws; So it fails.
			});
    }
    
    // Per fixture setup/teardown.
    class Contest_102 {
		// Fixture setup.
		_ before_each = test => {
			User.Create("pipe");
			User.Create("vilmis");
			User.Create("amiralles");
		};

		// Fixture teardown.
		_ after_each = test => {
			User.Reset();
		};
		
		// Actual test cases.
		_ should_find_existing_users = assert => 
			assert.IsNotNull(User.Find("pipe"));

		_ should_return_null_when_cant_find_the_user = assert => 
			assert.IsNull(User.Find("not_exists"));

		_ should_add_new_users = assert => {
			User.Create("foo");
			assert.Equal(4, User.Count());
		};
    }

	// Per test case setup/teardown.
	class Contest_103 {
		_ before_echo = test => 
			test.Bag["msg"] = "Hello World!";

		_ after_echo = test => 
			test.Bag["msg"] = null;

        //actual test.
		_ echo = test => 
			test.Equal("Hello World!", Utils.Echo(test.Bag["msg"]));
	}

    //=================================================================
    // Dummies
    //=================================================================
	class Utils {
		public static Func<object, object> Echo = msg => msg;
	}
	
	public class User {	
		static readonly List<string> _users = new List<string>();
		public static Action Reset = () => _users.Clear();
		public static Action<string> Create = name => _users.Add(name);
		public static Func<int> Count = () => _users.Count;
		public static Func<string, object> Find = name => _users.FirstOrDefault(u => u == name);
	}
    //=================================================================
```

		
#### A word about conventions
As I mentioned earlier, contest it's based on conventions so you don't have to deal with noisy annotations and stuff like that. It follows a basic set of rules that _I hope_ are easy to remember.

**Every field of type System.Action\<Contest.Core.Runner\> within a given assembly is considered to be a test case**. As you can see in the samples, neither the class containing the field nor the filed itself have to be public. This is just for convenience. I like to save as much keystrokes as I can, but it will work with public as well.

#### How about setups and teardowns?
If you 've been doing unit testing for a while you surely had notice that most frameworks have some kind of **setup/teardown** mechanisms (using NUnit jargon in here). Contest is not an exception, it have both, **per case** and **per fixture** setups and teardowns. The way it works is you name the field **"before_each"** for fixture wide setups and **"after_each"** for fixture wide teardowns. If you wanna per case setup/teardown, what you do is create a field and prefix its name with: **before_[case_name]** for setups and **after_[case_name]** for teardowns.
And remember, in all cases, **fields type must be System.Action\<Contest.Core.Runner\>**. Otherwise, it ain't gonna work.

#### Cherry picking
##### You can use wildcards to ask Contest to filter your fixtures and only run matching tests.
```bash
contest run test.dll *test_name_contains*
contest run test.dll test_name_starts_with*
contest run test.dll *test_name_ends_with
```

##### How to ignore tests using .test\_ignore file.
**TODO:

#### How to run *Contest*
The easiest way to run Contest, it's by adding _contest.exe_ to your path. Once you 've done that, you can go to whatever directory and just run: **contest run test\_cases.dll**

#### What the hell is that underscore thing?
A cool thing you can do to save even more keystrokes, is to **alias** the type **System.Action\<Contest.Core.Runner\>** to **_** (or whatever you like). That's what I did in the samples above to get more readable test code (and nobody cares about test cases's return types anyways).


**Thanks for reading! And lemme know if you have any trouble using this library**
